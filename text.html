      Dear Ma’am/Sir,
      <br> <br>
      I am writing to express my strong interest in the Frontend Developer position at your company, as advertised. With
      over six years of experience in the IT industry and a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, I have
      developed a strong foundation in creating responsive, user-focused web applications using modern frontend
      technologies.
      <br> <br>
      My technical skills include HTML, CSS (Bootstrap, Tailwind, SASS), and JavaScript, along with frameworks like
      React.js, Next.js, and Redux. I am well-versed in version control using Git, and have collaborated effectively
      with teams through platforms like GitHub and GitLab. In addition, I have experience deploying and managing
      applications using Microsoft Azure and AWS. I also leverage tools like Storybook for component-driven development
      and to ensure scalable, maintainable code.
      <br> <br>
      Beyond coding, I bring a design-conscious mindset to development. My familiarity with tools like Figma, Adobe XD,
      Photoshop, and Illustrator allows me to work seamlessly with UI/UX designers and ensure that design intentions are
      brought to life in the final product.
      <br> <br>
      What drives me as a developer is the opportunity to build intuitive, high-performance interfaces that deliver real
      value to users. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and thrive in collaborative environments where
      learning and innovation are encouraged.
      <br> <br>
      I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and help create exceptional digital experiences. I
      would welcome the chance to discuss how my background and skills can align with your team’s goals.
      Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you further.
      <br> <br>
      Sincerely,
      John Lloyd Mayol
